That guy up there is me.  Jim Mendes.

Maybe you figured that out already.  

## The Purpose of this Site

We've all been there.  That annoying spreadsheet that YOU KNOW is going to eat up half your day.  

Of course, if you're lucky, there's that one person in your office that's pretty good with Excel.  You're hoping they'll be able to help you shave some time off that four hours.

For a lot of people, I'm that person.

When I first started working in an office, I remember using my break time to explore the computer programs, like some kind of freak.  

I would go into every menu in Excel and click on everything to see what each command did (now, we have a ribbon with all the little icons to click on).  I did this with Excel.  With Word.  With Outlook.  With Notepad.  With every Windows Settings page.  

I used to enter "=" into an Excel sheet and then go through all of the formulas.

Not sure why I did these things.  I was looking for truth in there, or something.

In any case, the effect all of that wasted time had was to make me pretty good with Excel (and Word...and Outlook...pretty much any program on my work computer when I was bored).

That guy, remember.

So the purpose of this site is to pass on some of what I've learned over the years.  To SCALE the advice that I've been giving to co-workers.

So here I am.  Now I'm your that guy.

Hope you enjoy yourself here.  And maybe learn something in the process.

At some point, I'll likely sit down and write a proper About Me page. For now, you have this.

That guy up there is me.  Jim Mendes.

Hopefully, you figured that out already. But, if not, that's cool. Sometimes I'm a little slow on the upkeep myself. You and I, we both have a lot of stuff on our minds these days. Sometimes we miss obvious facts. Can't be avoided. We shouldn't feel bad.

If you're interested in my professional history, check out [my LinkedIn page](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmendes), which is relatively up-to-date. I spent a lot of time on that thing, so it makes me feel good when someone reads it. On the other hand, I sometimes get those weird emails from LinkedIn saying that someone has looked at my profile. The worst ones are when some anonymous LinkedIn user views my profile in "Private Mode." If you're going to go over there and look at my profile, at least have the decency to NOT do it in Private Mode. Private Mode is just creepy. You're better than that.

## The Purpose of this Site

As those that know me will tell you, one of the defining traits of my personality is crippling laziness. Fortunately (for you!) one of the by-products of this massive lack of desire to do work is that my mind works very hard (see the irony) to figure out the simplest, quickest way to accomplish any task.

These days they call it working smarter, not harder.

The purpose of this site is to give me a place to document the little tips and tricks I've developed over the years that have helped me lead a relatively organized and productive life (despite the aforementioned crippling laziness).

By putting all of this (CONTENT!) stuff on a website, it avoids my having to explain it to each of you individually. 

That's me working smarter, not harder.

See.

<!-- ## Technical Stuff

So one of the great things about having this website is it gives me a chance to do one of my favorite things: fart around on the computer. And that's probably my favorite thing to do.

Unlike 99.9% of blogs these days, this site is not built on Wordpress. I love Wordpress. I've worked with it a ton. It's great.

But it's not THE FUTURE.

The future of sites (like this one) on the web is headless CMS, or the JAM stack.

Which is why I built this site on Netlify's headless architecture. -->
